				Following the footsteps of technology giants, we emphasized on keeping #ChatAE as simple as possible.
				We are supporters of Modern, Material, and Flat designs, and therefore adhere to the "content before chrome" guidelines:
				keeping various imaging effects to as little as possible, while presenting our users with precise, to-the-point information,
				while maintaining the asthetics of #ChatAE
